<p>The theme of our website was Game Of Thrones, the HBO show based in the seven kingdoms of Westerous with many head figures fighting for the throne.
</p>
<p2>The design of our website shows off the the classic iron throne of Game of Thrones as the header.
   It also illustrates the night king threatening all of man kind on the left side, with one of
   Daenerys Targaryen's powerful dragons on the right. In the middle is each student's picture.
   The main color theme of the website follows the fire of Targaryen's dragons. In order to
   capture this we have made each day box a place of fire bordered in the gold which drives
   many in the series. The background of the webiste follows this theme as gold dust on a
    black background. The font used on our website is called Cizel Decorative and was choosen 
    to give off an impression of a medieval setting such as the one in Game of Thrones, with shadow behind it to make the words more clear. After
    each day box is a picture of one of the three main characters of the series.Finally, the
    formatting of the website was made to create a clear and easy to use application for our class.
